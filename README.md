Warning: The raw data is very large. 

## How to run code and reproduce results
In **Code** folder, the notebooks are named in chronological order containing the main purpose.   
To run the notebooks, download the data to **Code** folder. 

`01_data_preprocessing.ipynb` saves the final data for analysis at the end.   
`02_EDA.ipynb` uses the final data from the previous notebook and do EDA.   
`03_modeling.ipynb` contains different approaches for classification.
